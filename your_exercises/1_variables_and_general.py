# function: Leap year checker
    # receive a year from the user and convert it to an int
    # Leap year logic: the year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100 while also being divisible by 400
        # You'll need to remember that the % operator shows the remainder of a division operation
            # ex: 4 % 2 = 0, 5 % 2 = 1
        # the comparison operator for saying "not equal to" is !=
            # ex:
                # if "test" != "Test String":
                    # print("run this code")
